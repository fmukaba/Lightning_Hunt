            <p> <b>Orator</b>: Hello captain. Welcome to Lightning Hunt island. So you heard about the legend huh?
                Somewhere on this island is a chest which contains the potion to gain the ability to summon lightning and thunderstorms. <br> 
                But beware, the island is haunted. When you find the chest, the island will present a riddle to you and if you answer incorrectly, it shall surely swallow you alive.<br>
                A lot of pirates have tried, but they all perished. You only have 60 seconds total. 
                Whenever you are ready to take on this challenge, make your way into the enchanted forest...
